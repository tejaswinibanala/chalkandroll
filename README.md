**ChalkAndRoll School Application**
This project is a Spring Boot application named ChalkAndRoll School Application, developed to demonstrate key Spring concepts and best practices. It showcases a comprehensive learning journey through Spring's core features, from basic Bean configurations to advanced aspects like AOP, Spring Security, and RESTful APIs.

**Topics Covered****
1. Beans and Bean Models**
Bean Scopes: singleton, prototype, request, session, and application.
Lifecycle Management: Using @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy, InitializingBean, and DisposableBean.
Configuration Approaches:
XML-based (<bean> tags)
Java-based (@Configuration, @Bean)
Annotation-based (@Component, @Service, @Repository)
**2. Autowiring Concepts**
Types of Autowiring:
@Autowired: Dependency injection by type.
@Qualifier: Resolves conflicts between multiple beans.
@Primary: Default selection among multiple beans.
Handling Conflicts and Circular Dependencies:
Using @Qualifier and @Lazy.
Best practices for decoupled design.
**3. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**
Purpose: Modularizes cross-cutting concerns (logging, security, transactions).
Key Concepts:
Aspect, Advice, Join Point, and Pointcut.
@Before, @After, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing, and @Around.
Implementation:
Using @Aspect and configuring with @EnableAspectJAutoProxy.
**4. Spring Data JPA**
Repository Abstraction: Simplifies database operations.
Custom Queries: Using @Query.
Transaction Management: With @Transactional.
**5. Spring Data REST**
Purpose: Exposes RESTful APIs for JPA repositories.
Features:
HAL explorer for navigating REST APIs.
Custom endpoints and projections.
**6. Spring Security**
Authentication and Authorization:
Role-based access control using @PreAuthorize and @Secured.
Thymeleaf Integration: Secured templates using Spring Security Extras.
**7. RESTful APIs**
Development: With @RestController and @RequestBody.
Validation: Using @Valid and @NotNull.
Response Handling: Using ResponseEntity.
**8. Thymeleaf Templates**
Dynamic Views: Using Spring expressions (th:text, th:if).
Form Validation and Error Handling.
**9. Database Integration**
PostgreSQL: Configured with Spring Boot starter dependencies and managed with database migrations.
Featured Project: SpringApplication1
This is a fully implemented school management application showcasing advanced Spring concepts. It provides a robust backend solution with the following key features:

**AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming):** Logging, performance monitoring, and method-level interception.
**Spring Security:** User authentication and authorization.
**Spring Data REST with HAL:** Hypermedia support for easy navigation.
**Spring Data JPA:** Simplified database interactions.
**Validation:** Using spring-boot-starter-validation.
**REST APIs:** For CRUD operations.
**Thymeleaf Integration:** Dynamic views and templates.
**PostgreSQL:** As the database backend.
**Features:**
**CRUD Operations:** Managing students, teachers, and courses.
**Role-Based Access Control:** Securing endpoints.
**HAL Explorer:** Auto-generated REST APIs.
**Dynamic Front-End Templates:** With form validation.
Build & Configuration
